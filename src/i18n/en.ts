    aiServerOverview:
        '<0>This page features a <0>chat powered by artificial intelligence</0>, which operates on a specially designed server infrastructure. The AI server supporting this functionality was built independently, using dedicated Docker containers. The first container contains the Ollama API, which processes queries and generates responses in real time. The second container is based on NGINX, which serves as a security gateway — it receives all requests, verifies them, and if they are valid, forwards them to the Ollama API.</0> <1>The infrastructure was built using the Bicep language, which allows for declarative management of resources in Azure cloud. Additionally, the continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) process has been automated using GitHub Actions, enabling rapid deployment of new changes. More information about this project can be found on GitHub: <0>AI cloud service repository</0>.</1>',
